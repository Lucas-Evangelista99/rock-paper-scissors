# rock-paper-scissors

This project is a simple "Rock Paper Scissors" game that uses basic javaScript, allowing people to play it in their browser's console. 

NOTE:
This project is not complete! I'll work on implementing a GUI to it!

UPDATE - 23/07/2022

The project is now complete! it now has a GUI and the user can play the game by clicking the buttons instead of playing it on the browser's console! I achieved this by adding a CSS file and some DOM manipulation methods to the js file! Hope you enjoy!
